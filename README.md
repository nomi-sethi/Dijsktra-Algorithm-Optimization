# Dijsktra-s-Algorithm-Optimization
A Fast Algorithm to Find All-Pairs Shortest Paths in Complex Networks - sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050912001810

In this project, the above mentioned paper is implemeted,
and original dijsktra algorithm are optimized with the suggestions given in this paper.

Later, the results are compared with the Floyd-Marshell Algorithm of all-pairs shortest path
which are given are displayed graphically.

For the complete understanding, you should read the paper first. Thank You!
