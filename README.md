# Dijsktra-Algorithm-Optimization-to-find-all-pairs-shortest-path
[**A Fast Algorithm to Find All-Pairs Shortest Paths in Complex Networks**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050912001810)

In this project, the above mentioned paper is implemeted,
and original dijsktra algorithm are optimized with the suggestions given in this paper.

Later, the results are compared with the Floyd-Marshell Algorithm of all-pairs shortest path
which are given are displayed graphically.

Should you need the deep understanding, kindly read the paper. Thank You!
